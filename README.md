[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/koekeishiya/skhd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/koekeishiya/skhd)

**skhd** is a simple hotkey daemon for macOS. It is a stripped version of [**khd** (*no longer maintained*)](https://github.com/koekeishiya/khd) (although rewritten from scratch), that sacrifices the more advanced features in favour of increased responsiveness and performance.
**skhd** is able to hotload its config file, meaning that hotkeys can be edited and updated live while **skhd** is running.

**skhd** uses a pid-file to make sure that only one instance is running at any moment in time. This also allows for the ability to trigger a manual reload of the config file by invoking `skhd --reload` at any moment while an instance of **skhd** is running. The pid-file is saved as `/tmp/skhd_$USER.pid`, so the user that is running **skhd** must have write permission to aformentioned path.

Feature comparison between **skhd** and **khd**:

### Install

The first time **skhd** is ran, it will request access to the accessibility API.

After access has been granted, the application must be restarted.

*Notice:* Secure Keyboard Entry must be disabled for **skhd** to receive key-events.

**Homebrew**:

Requires xcode-8 command-line tools.

    brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
    brew services start skhd

**Source**:

Requires xcode-8 command-line tools.

    git clone https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd
    make install      # release version
    make              # debug version

### Usage

    -V | --verbose: Output debug information
        skhd -V

    -P | --profile: Output profiling information
        skhd -P

    -v | --version: Print version number to stdout
        skhd -v

    -c | --config: Specify location of config file
        skhd -c ~/.skhdrc

    -o | --observe: Output keycode and modifiers of event. Ctrl+C to quit
        skhd -o

    -r | --reload: Signal a running instance of skhd to reload its config file
        skhd -r

    -h | --no-hotload: Disable system for hotloading config file
        skhd -h

    -k | --key: Synthesize a keypress (same syntax as when defining a hotkey)
        skhd -k "shift + alt - 7"

    -t | --text: Synthesize a line of text
        skhd -t "hello, worldã‚·"

### Configuration

The default configuration file is located at one of the following places (in order):

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/skhd/skhdrc`
- `$HOME/.config/skhd/skhdrc`
- `$HOME/.skhdrc`

A different location can be specified with the ```--config | -c``` argument.

A sample config is available [here](https://github.com/Nobody912/skhd/blob/master/examples/skhdrc).

A list of all built-in modifier and literal keywords can be found [here](https://github.com/Nobody912/skhd/blob/master/KEYS.md).

A hotkey is written according to the following rules:

    hotkey       = <mode> '<' <action> | <action>

    mode         = 'name of mode' | <mode> ',' <mode>

    action       = <keysym> '[' <proc_map_lst> ']' | <keysym> '->' '[' <proc_map_lst> ']'
                <keysym> ':' <command>          | <keysym> '->' ':' <command>
                <keysym> ';' <mode>             | <keysym> '->' ';' <mode>

    keysym       = <mod> '-' <key> | <key>

    mod          = 'modifier keyword' | <mod> '+' <mod>

    key          = <literal> | <keycode>

    literal      = 'single letter or built-in keyword'

    keycode      = 'apple keyboard kVK_<Key> values (0x3C)'

    proc_map_lst = * <proc_map>

    proc_map     = <string> ':' <command> | <string>     '~' |
                '*'      ':' <command> | '*'          '~'

    string       = '"' 'sequence of characters' '"'

    command      = command is executed through '$SHELL -c' and
                   follows valid shell syntax. if the $SHELL environment
                   variable is not set, it will default to '/bin/bash'.
                   when bash is used, the ';' delimeter can be specified
                   to chain commands.

                   to allow a command to extend into multiple lines,
                   prepend '\' at the end of the previous line.

                   an EOL character signifies the end of the bind.

    ->           = keypress is not consumed by skhd

    *            = matches every application not specified in <proc_map_lst>

    ~            = application is unbound and keypress is forwarded per usual, 
                   when specified in a <proc_map>

A mode is declared according to the following rules:

    mode_decl = '::' <name> '@' ':' <command> | '::' <name> ':' <command> |
                '::' <name> '@'               | '::' <name>

    name    = desired name for this mode,

    @       = capture keypresses regardless of being bound to an action

    command = command is executed through '$SHELL -c' and
            follows valid shell syntax. if the $SHELL environment
            variable is not set, it will default to '/bin/bash'.
            when bash is used, the ';' delimeter can be specified
            to chain commands.

            to allow a command to extend into multiple lines,
            prepend '\' at the end of the previous line.

            an EOL character signifies the end of the bind.

General options that configure the behaviour of **skhd**:

    # specify a file that should be included as an additional config-file.
    # treated as an absolutepath if the filename begins with '/' otherwise
    # the file is relative to the path of the config-file it was loaded from.

    .load "/Users/Koe/.config/partial_skhdrc"
    .load "partial_skhdrc"

    # prevents skhd from monitoring events for listed processes.

    .blacklist [
        "terminal"
        "qutebrowser"
        "kitty"
        "google chrome"
    ]
